# TitleTransfer
A distributed application to register users and properties and handle transfer of properties among users and validate.

## Running the project in a development environment
### Requirements
1. Truffle          - to compile and deploy contracts
2. Ganache/Test-RPC - to run local development ethereum network
3. npm              - to run the project
4. Metamask         - ethereum wallet (browser extension)

### Setup
1. Start ganache/test-rpc on port *8545*
    * By default ganache starts on port 7545
    * If so, goto settings and change port to 8545
    * Hit restart
2. In browser connect Metamask to local network on port *8545* and log in
4. Import first five accounts from local blockchain network -
    * Copy private key of first account from ganche/test-rpc
    * In Metamask => import accounts , select private key
    * Paste the private key and press import
    * You should see Account\# with some ethereum
    * If running the project for first time
      * Goto Settings and reset account
      * This should clear any old transactions linked to the account
      * Without this step you might see Incorrect nonce error in console
    * Similarly import at least one more account from Ganache/test-rpc
5. Migrate contracts to local ethereum network using truffle
    1. On linux ```truffle migrate --development --reset```
    2. On windows ```truffle.cmd migrate --development --reset```
    3. The first account visible in ganche/test-rpc will be the *Owner* of the contract 
    
After successful setup with no errors the project can be started by running
```npm run dev```
If missing module errors come up try again after running ```npm install```
After running the server sucessfully the DAPP can be accessed on localhost:3000

## Flow of the DAPP
The purpose of the DAPP is to enable users to register themselves as well as their properties in a decentralized manner. An individual can be identified by her _SSN_ and a property by _Property Registry Number_ both of which for now are integers between 0 and 65535 (16 bit integers). 

1. Every _SSN_ or individual is associated to an address of an individual ethereum account. 
      * Any activity of registering a property or transffering a property belonging to the _SSN_ must be submitted from the registered account only.
      * An _SSN_ can be registered to an address by entering the _SSN_ in the SSN input field under heading *Individual Registry*
      * On clicking _Register_ button Metamask will prompt to submit transaction, hit submit.
        * If transcation succeeds Metamask will notify the user.
        * If transaction fails with a propmt "Identity Mismatch" it means that the supplied _SSN_ is already registered with a differnt account than the one open in Metamask currently. This error is not treated as a failed transaction, thus ether will be charged as for a successful transaction.
2. Every _Property Registry Number_ or property is associated with an _SSN_, the _SSN_ must be previously registered under *Individual Registry*
      * A _Property Registry Number_ can be registered with an _SSN_ under heading *Property Registry*
      * On clicking _Register_ button Metamask will prompt to submit the transaction, hit submit.
        * If transaction fails with a proppt "Identity Mismatch" it means that the _SSN_ supplied is not registered with the account currently open in Metamask.
        * If transaction fails with a prompt "Property Mismatch" it means that the _Property Registry Number_ supplied is already registered to some other SSN or individual.
        * Both the above errors are not treated as failure so ethers will be charged as for successful transactions.
3. Transferring _Property Registry Number_ from _Seller_ to _Buyer_
      * This transaction must be initiated while the account of the seller is logged in Metamask i.e. transfer is initiated by the seller
      * Supply the _Seller_ SSN and the _Buyer_ SSN along with the _Property Registry Number_ to transfer
      * On clicking _Transfer_ button Metamask will prompt to submit the transaction, hit submit.
        * If transaction fails with a proppt "Identity Mismatch" it means that the _SSN_ supplied is not registered with the account currently open in Metamask.
        * If transaction fails with a prompt "Property Mismatch" it means that the _Property Registry Number_ supplied is already registered to some other SSN or individual.
        * Both the above errors are not treated as failure so ethers will be charged as for successful transactions.
4. Viewing the registered _Property Registry Number_ with owner's _SSN_
      * Only the admin can view the registered properties and their owner
        * The first account in Ganache/test-rpc will be the owner under unchanged configurations
      * The owner needs to refresh the page after logging into her account with Metamask to see the registered properties.
      
## Structure of the project
1. ```src``` contains the html, css, javascript files
    1. ```src/index.html``` contains the html code of the webpage
    2. ```src/js/app.js``` contains the javascript code that handles all the action
          * Attaching actions to the html page
          * Attaching to the Web3 provider, in browser that is Metamask
          * Calling transactions to change data on the contract
          * Reading data from the contract
          * Watching for events emmited by the contract
2. ```Contracts``` folder contains the contract ```Title.sol``` and ```Migrations.sol```
    1. ```Title.sol``` is the contract of attention and contains all the relevant logic
3. ```build\Contract``` folder contains the compiled Contracts as ```.json``` files
4. ```Migrations``` folder contains the Migration files that are needed while deploying contracts on to a network

## Editing the project
1. To change the port on which the ethreum network is running change _port_ attribute in ```truffle.js``` file.
2. After altering the contracts they need to be redeployed. This can be done in a similar manner as during the *Setup*
3. If the server is running, any changes to html or javascript code will be automatically reloaded or might require refreshing the page

## Important Warnings
1. If metamask is not connected to the local network the page will show no content.
2. During development the user should also open the console to detect errors
